* OVERVIEW.md is the overarching project goal. When work is deviating from that, be sure to bring
  that to my attention.
* This project is to primarily be developed in the Go programming language.
* Prefer low-dependencies, clarity over cleverness
* Always write tests when appropriate. Regularly check that tests are passing.
