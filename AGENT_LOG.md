# AGENT_LOG

## 2026-01-18 — Phase 1 implementation plan (initial)

- Phase 1 target per `specs/phase_1/PHASE_1.md`: planning-only agent integration (generate/refine/deps infer), durable plan file, validation/explainability, and a usable ready-task loop (list/show/pick + manual status updates).
- Keep dependencies low and the implementation clear (Go-first).
- Prefer a single, human-readable plan file stored at repo root; use JSON to avoid YAML dependencies.
- Agent runtime integration will be pluggable via an external command hook that returns machine-readable JSON (full plan or patch ops), with a manual-mode fallback.

## 2026-01-18 — Repo organization update

- Moved Phase 1 spec into `specs/phase_1/PHASE_1.md`.
- Added `specs/phase_1/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` capturing the Phase 1 build order and architecture.

## 2026-01-18 — Phase 1 milestone sub-specs

- Created one sub-spec per Phase 1 milestone under `specs/phase_1/milestones/` (M1–M6).
- Linked milestone docs from `specs/phase_1/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`.

## 2026-01-18 — M1: Foundation (Go module + Plan IO + Atomic Writes + Validate)

- Implemented a minimal Go CLI skeleton (`cmd/blackbird`) with `init` and `validate`.
- Added `internal/plan` with:
  - `WorkGraph` / `WorkItem` types (JSON, RFC3339 timestamps via `time.Time`).
  - Strict JSON loading (`DisallowUnknownFields`) and pretty-printed JSON saving.
  - Atomic write semantics (temp file in same dir + fsync file + rename + fsync dir).
  - Validation for required fields, reference existence, parent/child consistency, and hierarchy cycle detection.
- Documented the plan file schema and M1 validation behavior in `README.md`.
- Note: could not run `go test`/`gofmt` in this environment because the Go toolchain was not available (`go` not found). Run `go test ./...` locally to verify.

## 2026-01-18 — Repo initialized as git

- The project is now a git repo (no commits yet).
- No `origin` remote is configured yet. `go.mod` is set to `github.com/jbonatakis/blackbird` (update if/when the canonical remote URL differs).
